# deep-learning-challenge
In this project, I used machine learning to help a nonprofit foundation select applicants for funding its ventures. 

To complete this project, I proprocessed the data to find the features and target variables. I then used StandardScalar() to make the data usable. I also used pd.get_dummies to make categorical data into integers. After that, I used the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing data. 

After preprocessing the data. I used TensorFlow and Pytorch to create a model to evaluate the data.

If you would like to look at my code. It can be found in the 'Starter_code' File.
